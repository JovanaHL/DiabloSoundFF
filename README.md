This project captures on-screen text using Robot's screen capture capabilities and extracts text using Tesseract to trigger a sound effect whenever a player completes a World Event in Diablo IV.

When a player completes a 'World Event' the text "EVENT COMPLETE" appears on the screen. This plug-in like script detects this text on the screen and plays a sound effect. To make things fun, the sound effect that plays is the famous Final Fantasy Victory Fanfare music specific to the Final Fantasy franchise. Although Diablo IV doesn't allow plug ins or mods, I thought it would be fun to try to work around this, therefore this plug in would only be run locally and it is on a very basic timer. 


Inspired by the Final Fantasy Among Us Sound Effect Plug-In: https://gist.github.com/ry00001/bd2a9f52cf128fcd1a5c38a1ac5222a4
